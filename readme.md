# Backend Database in Lumen

I recently started my first developer job. It's been exciting but of course it has it's own set of challenges. (The biggest obstacle being it's the LAMP stack and I've learned the MERN stack.) 

My first week was focused on getting myself familiar with CRUD and a deep dive into Angular 7.

I used MySQL for the database, and the Lumen microframework.
